# Export contract — for every telemetry pet project

Contract version **1.1** (1.0 was given to Z4; the changes are listed at the
end). Put the version you were given in `MANIFEST.json`.

You are building a small, ordinary AI agent. Its only job beyond working is
to be **instrumented by stock instrumentation and to export its telemetry
over OTLP**. You do not know, and must not guess, what consumes the
telemetry. Build the agent the way anyone would build one; let the
instrumentor decide what a span looks like.

## 1. What you deliver

A repository with:

- the agent, runnable with `make run` (and `make run ENDPOINT=http://host:port`
  to override where telemetry goes; default `http://localhost:4318`);
- `make run-recorded`: the same run against a **key-free** OpenAI-compatible
  stub you provide (a tiny local server returning scripted completions and
  tool calls is fine), so a stranger can run it with no credentials;
- `make run-real`: the same run against a real model, which you execute
  **once** and whose telemetry you do not need to keep — the collector on our
  side keeps it;
- `README.md` with: the framework and instrumentation packages **pinned to
  exact versions**, the model used for the real run, and a one-paragraph
  description of what the agent does;
- a `MANIFEST.json` written by `make run` next to nothing else:
  `{"contract_version": "1.1", "framework": "...", "framework_version": "...",
  "instrumentation": ["pkg==ver", ...], "sdk": {"opentelemetry-sdk": "...",
  "exporter": "pkg==ver"}, "python": "3.x.y", "platform": "...",
  "model": "...", "mode": "recorded" | "real", "endpoint": "...",
  "started_at": "<ISO-8601>"}`. When there is no agent framework (a bare
  client), `framework` is the client library and `framework_version` its
  version.
- `make run` with no arguments is the recorded mode, so the default works
  with no credentials. A full lock of the dependency tree installed with
  `--no-deps` is the recommended way to keep the pins exact.

## 2. Instrumentation rules

- Use the **stock instrumentation package** your brief names (an OpenInference
  instrumentor, or the OpenTelemetry GenAI instrumentation). Do not write
  spans by hand, do not add attributes, do not rename anything, do not
  filter. If the instrumentor emits something odd, that is the point.
- Pin the **newest versions of the framework and the instrumentor that work
  together**. If the newest of one is incompatible with the other, pin the
  newest compatible pair and say in `README.md` what broke — that
  incompatibility is itself something we want recorded, not worked around
  silently.
- If the instrumentation offers a **content-capture** setting, turn it on in
  the mode that puts message content **on spans** (some packages' legacy
  mode puts it on log records, which never leave the process here), using
  only the environment variables the instrumentation documents. Record the
  exact variables and values in `README.md`.
- Use the **stock OpenTelemetry SDK** with a `BatchSpanProcessor` at its
  defaults and the stock OTLP/HTTP exporter at its defaults. Do not switch
  to a simple processor to make export tidy; do not set a custom encoding
  unless your brief says so.
- Export to `$ENDPOINT/v1/traces` (the SDK's default path). Nothing else is
  required of the endpoint; whatever the exporter sends by default is
  correct.
- Do **not** install, import, read, or mention any trace-consuming library.
  If you find yourself wondering what the receiver wants, stop: it wants
  whatever your exporter sends.

## 3. The run

- `make run` performs **one complete agent run** of the scenario in your
  brief, then exits — flushing the tracer provider on exit the way the SDK
  documents (`shutdown()`), and no other way.
- The run must be **deterministic under `make run-recorded`**: same prompts,
  same tool results, same number of steps on every run — and the same
  values in what the SDK records on its own: a fixed stub port, a fixed
  service name (`OTEL_SERVICE_NAME`, stock SDK resource configuration), a
  fixed stub model name. Randomness in the real run is fine.
- Do not catch and hide errors the scenario is meant to produce; let them
  reach the instrumentor.

## 4. What you must not do

- No knowledge of the consumer. No "making the spans nicer". No sampling.
- No custom exporter, no custom span processor, no manual `start_span` around
  framework calls the instrumentor already covers (manual spans are allowed
  only where your brief asks for them, and then only with the SDK's own API).
- No secrets in the repository. `make run-real` reads the key from the
  environment.

## 5. Definition of done

A stranger with Python and no credentials can clone the repository, run
`make run-recorded ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4318` against any OTLP endpoint
(or none — the SDK logs export failures and the run still completes), and
read `MANIFEST.json` afterwards. A reviewer will do exactly that on a
machine that has never seen the repository. You have run `make run-real`
once with the endpoint we gave you. You could not say what the consumer of
the telemetry is, and you have not tried to find out.

## 6. Report back

When you are done, report in ten lines: the repository URL, the packages and
versions pinned, the model intended for the real run, and **every point
where this contract or your brief left you guessing** — what you guessed and
why. Those guesses are how the contract improves.

---

Changes from 1.0 (after the Z4 pilot's ten recorded assumptions): newest
compatible pair with the incompatibility recorded; content capture on spans
with the variables recorded; determinism covers SDK-recorded values;
`make run` defaults to recorded; manifest gains `contract_version`,
`python`, `platform`, `mode`, and defines `framework` for a bare client;
the stranger run is stated as a review step; §6 added.
